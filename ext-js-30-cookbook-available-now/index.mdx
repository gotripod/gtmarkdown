The [Ext JS 3.0 Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/ext-js-3-0-cookbook/) by [Jorge Ramon](http://miamicoder.com/) is now available. As Jorge says in his [introductory post](http://www.miamicoder.com/post/2009/08/Announcing-the-Ext-JS-30-Cookbook.aspx):

> The Ext JS 3.0 Cookbook is for developers who want a book of useful techniques, with explanations, that they can refer to and adapt to their purposes.

I was a Technical Reviewer for this book, and it contains not just simple recipes to get you started, but complex ones to allow you to bend Ext JS to your will. If you buy Ext JS 3.0 Cookbook eBook along with the eBook edition of the book I co-authored, Learning Ext JS, you can get a 50% discount using the promo code **jsco34ler** on the [Packt website](http://www.packtpub.com/ext-js-3-0-cookbook/). Congratulations Jorge!
