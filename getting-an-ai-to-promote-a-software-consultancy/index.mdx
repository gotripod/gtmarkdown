Everyone's talking about [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/), a language model optimised for conversations. In a shameless attempt to ride the gravy train, I asked ChatGPT for some help in writing a blog post.

> **Me**: I need to write a blog post ASAP. Can you help?
>
> **ChatGPT**: Sure, I'd be happy to help! What would you like the blog post to be about?
>
> **Me**: Software. Software consulting, engineering, that kind of thing. And it needs to be stuffed with great keywords. Could you give me a sample and keep it under 50 words?
>
> **ChatGPT**: Here's a sample blog post about software consulting and engineering:
>

> In this post, some key words and phrases that could help improve search engine optimization (SEO) include "software consulting," "software engineering," "custom software solutions," "agile methodologies," and "cutting-edge technologies." Of course, the specific keywords that will be most effective will depend on your audience and your goals.
>
> **Me**: That's more than 50 words! Never mind, what hot new tech do you think we should talk about?
>
> **ChatGPT**: I'm sorry, I didn't realize that you wanted me to keep the post under 50 words. Here's a revised version that is within the word limit:
>

> As a large language model trained by OpenAI, I don't have the ability to browse the internet or keep up with the latest trends in technology. However, some hot topics in the software industry currently include cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. These technologies are being used to develop new software solutions that can improve efficiency, automate tasks, and provide insights that were previously impossible to obtain.

This comes across as a perfectly serviceable bunch of advice from someone familiar with software, SEO and copywriting. It might be lacking in spark, but let's be honest, people that grind out SEO content aren't going to win awards for creativity. I have a feeling we'll see a lot more auto-generated content in the very near future. Want to see if you can use models like this in your project? [Give us a shout](https://gotripod.com/contact/).
