Investigating Crazy Egg's heatmap and visitor tracking tool today, I found a nice bit of UI in their plans and signup process. The plans page itself looks sweet:

But the really slick part comes when you click the "Sign Up" button:

The other plans fade out and the signup form slides in - no page refresh, and an quick jump to the next step in the process. Good work Crazy Egg!
