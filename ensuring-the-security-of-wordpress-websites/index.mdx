We've worked with various content management systems (CMS) over the years but [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) is our favourite. Thanks to its powerful user interface and open source architecture, it's the most popular CMS on the planet. (In fact [its market share](https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/content_management) is 10 times the size of its closest rival!)

Whilst WordPress empowers millions of users to publish their own content, it also attracts hackers eager to find and exploit vulnerabilities in the WordPress system itself and (more often) in the myriad 3rd party WordPress plugins. As such, security issues are found on a regular basis and plugged just as regularly with frequent updates.

At Go Tripod, we thoroughly test any updates in a staging environment to ensure the new code doesn't cause any problems before it's pushed live to our clients' websites. We maintain the same care and attention throughout our development practice, investing time into researching the best tool for the job at hand.

So, to ensure our WordPress clients don't need to worry about the security of their own websites, we have recently partnered with a dedicated WordPress hosting company.

This means our WordPress clients enjoy:

- daily backups restored with a single click
- automated SSL/TLS certificates via [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
- unlimited development/staging environments
- rapid environment updates via [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- a built-in one-click CDN

Do you have a WordPress site? Is it secure? [Get in touch](/contact/) if you'd like to know more about what we can offer.
