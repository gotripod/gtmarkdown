Some time ago we wrote a post with [advice on creating stronger passwords](https://gotripod.com/insights/tip-creating-stronger-passwords/). These days it seems we need to interact with an ever growing list of password protected services. How to keep track of all of these? Most people don't have elephantine memories and so, understandably, do one of two things - they either use the same password for everything or they write down all their passwords (somewhere safe) for reference.

Needless to say both of these methods leave a lot to be desired. If one service is compromised, an enterprising hacker armed with your password might then easily find their way into additional accounts. (All they'd need to do is take a guess at what other services you use.) Alternatively, that notebook with all your passwords could get lost or stolen...

Arguably, the best way around this is to use a reliable [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager) to create and store unique, strong, genuinely random passwords for each of your online accounts. If this isn't your bag, another option is to remember one (strong) password and then use a simple rule to change it for each service you use. None of these solutions is foolproof but employing some system of password variance is certainly better than not doing so.

So, here's an example, first let's pick a memorable phrase. How about:

_Stop collaborate and listen Ice is back with a brand new invention_

Now, [following the advice from our previous post](https://gotripod.com/insights/tip-creating-stronger-passwords/), this becomes:

Sc+lIibw1bni

This isn't such a bad password - it's twelve characters long, it includes letters, numbers and symbols and some of the letters are capitalised. Now, let's imagine we need passwords for the following services:

1. Hotmail
2. Google
3. Natwest
4. Apple

All we need to do is to prefix or suffix our password with additional characters related to these services. In essence we're creating a differentiating pattern. A simple example might be to add the first three letters of each service to the end of our password. This would give us:

1. Sc+lIibw1bnihot
2. Sc+lIibw1bnigoo
3. Sc+lIibw1bninat
4. Sc+lIibw1bniapp

Although, what would be even safer would be to _prefix_ our password with the _last_ three letters of each service, like so:

1. ailSc+lIibw1bni
2. gleSc+lIibw1bni
3. estSc+lIibw1bni
4. pleSc+lIibw1bni

Why is this safer? Well, if one of these passwords is stolen, our differentiating pattern rule isn't quite as obvious. Similarly, if someone has an alphabetical list of many stolen passwords, ours won't appear consecutively (which, again, might reveal our rule). An even more obscure rule would of course be better still.

Stay safe out there!
