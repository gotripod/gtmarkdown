We've recently been extending our reach into the local area by approaching organisations that help connect businesses together. The first of these is [Falmouth's Business Improvement Distract (BID)](https://www.falmouth.co.uk/shopsandbusinesses/go-tripod/), who help boost the town by investing in marketing, business support, events and a variety of improvement mechanisms. The second is [Software Cornwall](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/member/gotripod/), who connect and support Cornwallâ€™s digital techology community. These are the first two in a series of partnerships we're entering into in order to better understand the needs of the local community.
