At Go Tripod we're all about process, streamlining how we work and interact with each other and our clients. Back in April [Colin wrote about some of our processes and the services we employ](https://gotripod.com/insights/we-work-remotely-why-and-how/), and we've just added a new one!

## Smallchat

Another add-on to our communication tool of choice, [Slack](https://slack.com/), [Smallchat](https://small.chat/) is a service which enables us to embed a simple chat service on our website. Live submissions come into a dedicated Slack channel allowing us to respond in real time to any enquiries. There are ample customisations available on the free plan including widget styling and operating hours (you can optionally let users leave a message for you out-of-hours).

We've also added some availability information to [our contact page](https://gotripod.com/contact/) so you can, at a glance, get an idea of how quickly we might be able to start on a new project.
