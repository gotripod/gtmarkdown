iPhone and Adobe Air developers (as well as any others that use SQLite 3) [Menial](http://menial.co.uk) has just released an excellent little app for creating, managing and running queries against SQLite 3 databases called Bases.

The application is simple to use, very user friendly and has worked well from the testing I have done. It costs just Â£10 and there is a free trial available so you can try before you buy.
