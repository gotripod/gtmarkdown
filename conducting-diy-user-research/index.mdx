[Leisa Reichelt](http://www.disambiguity.com) has posted up an [interesting presentation on DIY guerrilla User Research](http://www.disambiguity.com/diy-user-research-my-barcamp-presentation/) which is well worth a look. I have embedded her slideshow below.

She points out that no matter how small the budget, even a small amount of User Research can pay off in a big way. She goes through some of the techniques used by Interaction Designers when conducting research and some invaluable tips on conducting and writing interviews, it is well worth a look:
