WordPress and Ruby on Rails are two of our favourite technologies here at Go Tripod. Both make it easy to incorporate third-party code dependencies to get a project up and running quickly. Let's take a look at Rails & WordPress dependency management in this post.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When working with Rails, we leverage [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise), a battle-hardened library to add authentication (signup & sign-in) to a website. We can pull in projects like [kaminari](https://github.com/kaminari/kaminari) to help manage long lists of data; we can use [activity_notification](https://github.com/simukappu/activity_notification/) to build out social media-style user notifications; or use [cancancan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) to make sure users are authorised to perform certain actions.

We could write this code ourselves. Instead we take tried and tested community projects and integrate them into your project. Sometimes we go a step further, not only using code from third parties but using their services too.

## Stripy & SAASy

An example of this would be [Stripe](https://stripe.com/), a payment processor. As well as offering [open source code](https://github.com/stripe) to build checkout pages, they also provide a dashboard to visualise your income. Rather than spending time building screens display this information, we let Stripe's best in class team take care of that.

And while we currently use Devise for authentication, we're keeping an eye on services such as [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). It offers a software-as-a-service (SAAS) approach to user authentication, the same way that Stripe is a SAAS for payments.

Dependencies, either on code or on services, are necessary in modern software development. And yet we need to judiciously manage them: look at the [leftpad](https://qz.com/646467/how-one-programmer-broke-the-internet-by-deleting-a-tiny-piece-of-code/) saga and you can see how slippery a slope this can be.

## WordDepress

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

In [our experience](https://gotripod.com/topics/wordpress/), WordPress is extremely susceptible to this problem, since many people who build WordPress sites are designers, not developers. It's very easy to click into the plugins menu and build up functionality in just a few minutes, but WordPress dependency management brings problems just as leftpad did.

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

When we add a dependency to a project we should check it meets our requirements, but perform a health check - how many people maintain it? Does the author update it often? Do they keep on top of bug triage?

<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

Our skill and experience as developers not only lets us evaluate these dependencies on merit, but also examine the quality and health of a given library and efficiently integrate it with your project. We're plumbers, taking pieces of kit off the shelf and elegantly place it, combine it, and finesse it into something wonderful.

<!-- wp:paragraph -->

More importantly, not reinventing the wheel means we can focus on your business needs. We're still coding, but we're coding the things that really matter to you.
