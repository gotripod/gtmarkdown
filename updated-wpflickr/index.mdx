Just to let you all know I have updated WP-Flcikr, making it compatible with WordPress 2.5

As part of the update, I have fixed the following:

- Compatibility with WordPress 2.5
- Issue where users without curl installed would get an error authenticating
- Updated the style to match WordPress 2.5
- AJAX enabled the plugin to stop the page refresh (which ws incompatible with WordPress 2.5) when switching Photo Sets on the write/edit post page

If you are using WordPress 2.5, you can automatically upgrade to the latest version from the plugins page. If you are not already using WP-Flickr, you can download it here <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-flickr/>
