For all you Apple Mac fans out there, Mac OS X 10.5'92s release has been announced for the 26th October 2007 (As promised).

I have already pre-ordered my copy and looking forward to the [300 new features](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/300.html).

In particular:

Ruby on Rails - "Work in a developer's dreamland. Leopard is the perfect platform for Ruby on Rails development, with Rails, Mongrel, and Capistrano built in"
