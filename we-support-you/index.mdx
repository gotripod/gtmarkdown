When your application's out in the world, facing the rigours of daily use, there's always a possibility that annoying little bugs could start to appear – or, worse, that something critical breaks in an unexpected way.

That's why we're introducing GT Protect: a flexible support contract, giving you peace of mind that any surprise bugs will be taken care of quickly – without a sudden bill you hadn't budgeted for.

We will be contacting you shortly with the details sepcifically regarding your application. Of course, the support contract is not obligatory, but we hope you will find it really helpful and provides peace of mind.

For all support enquiries, problems, questions etc please use our new support ticket platform. To do this, just email your questiion or problem to [support@gotripod.com](mailto:support@gotripod.com) and a ticket will be created for you.
