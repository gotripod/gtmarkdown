After setting the scene for the software dependency management hellscape, we can now look at the practicalities. In this post, it's JavaScript dependency management that we're going to try and bend to our will.

In the olden days, we would include JavaScript in web pages using the script tag. It was a simpler time, and if you only need a couple of external libraries, this might still be the most sensible option. Just make sure that if you're making local copies of libraries that you take time to update them now and again. Likewise if you're pulling in specific versions of libraries from a remote server, be sure and audit them on a regular basis to get the latest security and performance updates.

The modern approach to JavaScript dependency management is to use packaged code from npm. This can be done with the npm tool itself, or with alternatives like yarn, and for the purposes of this article we'll assume this is all familiar to the user.
